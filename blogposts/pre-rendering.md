Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in _when_ it generates the HTML for a page.

In my experience, Static Generation works great for blog posts, marketing pages, and e-commerce product listings - basically, any page that can be built once and cached by a CDN.
Server-side Rendering is more suitable for pages that need to display frequently updated data, or where the content depends on user-specific information like authentication state. While it's slightly slower than Static Generation, it ensures the content is always fresh.

Here's a quick comparison:

- **Static Generation**:
  - HTML is generated at build time
  - Can be cached by CDN
  - Great for performance
  - Perfect for content that doesn't change often

- **Server-side Rendering**:
  - HTML is generated on each request
  - Always shows latest data
  - Slightly slower but more dynamic
  - Better for real-time content

The beauty of Next.js is that you can choose the rendering strategy on a per-page basis, allowing you to optimize each route according to its specific needs.
